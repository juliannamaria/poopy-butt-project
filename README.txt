ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------------
This project is fashioned after the well-known classic tale "The Odyssey".
This is a two-player game with a character selection menu that includes mythical figures Odysseus, Argos, Circe, and Achilles.
Each user will select their desired character according to an initial stats page and play these characters until 
either character reaches the magenta tile at the end of the game, indicating they have made it to Ithaca.
The journey consists of a series of encounters of different island and epic enemies that each character must 
defeat in order to continue onward. 
There will also be randomized encounters with hidden trasures, opportunities to shop, and calamities. 
Overall, the game includes numerous opportunities for thrilling battle and discoveries along the path to Ithaca.
